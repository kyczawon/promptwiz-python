    PromptWiz API - OpenAPI 3.1

    ### Context PromptWiz API provides a way to execute prompts defined in the UI. The API will return the results from OpenAI with fields populated based on your inputs and the result will be stored in PromptWiz for the purpose of analysis  ### Pre-requisites 1. You must create a prompt, and prompt version (and save it) 2. A prompt version must be set as ‘active’ in the prompt page 3. You must have a Open API Key set under api_keys page ## API modes 1. **Full result** - when stream is False, the API returns a single JSON response with the outcome of each query from querySet.     - Multiple requests are done in concurrent fashion for optimal response times 2. **Streaming** - when stream is True, the API returns multiple JSON responses through a Streaming response. The response body will have the exact same envelope as the full result mode, with the only difference being that the results field will contain the deltas that have been streamed by the model.     - Multiple requests are done in concurrent fashion & the streams will return on ‘first come first served’ basis. This means that envelopes might arrive out of order and you should rely on linkid to combine responses correctly.
